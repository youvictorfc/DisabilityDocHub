Technical Implementation with OpenAI Integration
Application Workflow DiagramDiagramÂ 
Technical Components:

Database Structure

Forms collection/table (form templates, metadata)
Form responses collection/table (user submissions, status)
Documents collection/table (policies, procedures, metadata)
Vector storage for document embeddings


OpenAI Integration

For Form Function: Use OpenAI to convert form documents into structured question flow
For Policy Assistant: Use embeddings for semantic search + GPT for answer generation
Implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system


File Handling

Document upload and processing pipeline
PDF generation for completed forms
Email integration for form submission



Replit Implementation Plan

Project Setup

Python Flask application
Database configuration (SQLite for simplicity or PostgreSQL for production)
OpenAI API integration
Basic authentication system


Form Processing System

Form upload interface for administrators
Form parser to extract questions and structure
Sequential question presentation interface
Form state management and progress saving
PDF generation and email functionality


Knowledge Base System

Document upload interface
Text extraction and processing
Vector embedding generation using OpenAI embeddings
Vector database integration (could use FAISS or similar)
Question-answering system with RAG approach


User Interface

Clean, accessible design
Search functionality for both forms and policies
Form completion interface with progress tracking
Chat interface for policy questions

Key Technical Challenges and Solutions:

Form Extraction & Structuring

Solution: Use OpenAI to parse PDF/DOCX form documents into structured JSON representations


Document Understanding

Solution: Chunk documents and generate embeddings for semantic retrieval


Answer Generation

Solution: Implement RAG pattern (retrieve relevant chunks + generate answers with context)


State Management

Solution: Session-based form progress tracking with database persistence
